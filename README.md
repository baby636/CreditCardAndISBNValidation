# CreditCardAndISBNValidation
Application for verifying credit card numbers and ISBN code developed by using JAVA

###Validation app for the credit card numbers and ISBN code

##Task

##Summary 

This application was built using Netbeans with Jframe. Netbeans comes with JAVA programming language which allows me to implement the back-end of the application based on the principle of object oriented programming such as treating each module as an object and each functionality as a method within the class. Jframe was also used for implementing this application, the user interface and layout were all designed using Jframe for linking all the functionality from the back-end with the front-end of the application.
